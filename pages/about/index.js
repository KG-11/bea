            in a state of constant flux, a student of the art in practice.
            beatnyk's work primarily revolves around reimaging sound design and
            music as a narrative medium, in a consistent attempt to unlearn and
            relearn the processes involved to construct a creative practice.
            experiments to study lead to working with other forms of media,
            either through practice or through collaborations.
